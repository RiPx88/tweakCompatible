This app also gives you UNLIMITED skips and the ability to disable ALL of the ads in Pandora. This app is completely free and compatible with the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. Itâ€™s like Pandora One for free, but better! Once youâ€™ve downloaded a song, you can listen to it from the Pandora Downloader app any time you want, even without an Internet connection! For your convenience, this app runs in the background, just like the native Music app.",
